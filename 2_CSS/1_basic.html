    <!-- CSS mainly depends on 4 factors -  -->

    <!-- 1. Specificity - An algorithm that determines which selector has the strongest match. For example , inline 
    selectors have higher specificity than class selectors , which have higher specificity than element selectors. -->

    <!-- 2. Inheritance - Some CSS properties are inherited from parent elements to child elements , meaning that if 
    a parent element has a certain style , its child elements may inherit that style unless they have their own
    specific styles applied. -->

    <!-- 3. Cascade - The term "cascading" in CSS refers to the way that styles cascade or pass down from parent to 
    child , and how conflicts between different styles are resolved. The cascade considers specificity , order of 
    appearance in the CSS. -->

    <!-- 4. Media Queries and Browser Compatibility - Media queries allow CSS to adapt styles based on the device's 
    characteristics , such as screen size , resolution , or orientation. -->

    <!-- There are 3 ways to add CSS - 1. Inline , 2. Internal , 3. External(Best way). -->
